To create a servlet project using intelij, we have mainly two ways you need:


FIRST WAY THAT WORKED BUT IS DEFINATELY WRONG!
1 - New project using "Java Enterprise";
2 - Choose the template to web or whatever you are using;
3 - Choose the application server, in our case tomcat;
4 - On the next page make sure to select either the "web profile"
in the "Specifications" folder, or the "Full plataform";
5 - After that you just need to run the server to see it running;

extra:

If you want to change the horrible url that the intelij artifact creates.
you just need to edit the run configuration of the tomcat, both at the server
and deployment tab;


SECOND WAY USING JETTY/TOMCAT BUT WAY BETTERRRRR AND RIGHT!
1 - New project using "Maven Archetype"
2 - In the Archetype section, choose "maven-archetype-webapp", cause like that
it will create a boiler plate with the folders n shit for you.
3 - Then inside of the project you have to choose between using Jetty or
Tomcat, for that we just have to add their plugin on the maven pom.xml.
4 - After that we can run the app at the port 8080 just by clicking on the
"maven" tab, looking for the "jetty" and then "jetty run".
5 - Now to use the servlets, we add the dependencies for it and the java class
to mess with it. Don't forget to also fix the web.xml inside of the "WEB-INF" folder,
updating the version that we can use the servlet.
